		<h2>Welcome to my travel page. Here you'll find a list of places around the world that I've been. Enjoy:)</h2>
			<h3>Mozambique, Africa, 2005</h3>

		<p class="Newclass">This was my first trip to Africa. I had wanted to go to Africa ever since I was young--I'd say The Lion King influenced me. I went with a church on a mission trip. Mozambique was unlike any other place I had ever been before. The extreme poverty is what impacted me the most.</p>

		<h3>Cape Town, South Africa, 2008</h3>
			<ol>

			</ol>
		
		<p>This was my second trip to Africa. Overall prettier I'd say than Mozambique. Beautiful mountains and good beaches. This was also a mission trip with my church.</p>

		<h3>Cape Town, South Africa (Part II), 2009</h3>
			<ol>
				<ul><img width="500px" src="Images/Cape-Town2.jpg"></ul>
			</ol>
		<p>I went back with my church to the same part of Cape Town as I did in 2008 where we ministered to the poor in a living community called a Township.</p>

		<h3>Scotland & England, 2009</h3>
			<ol>

			</ol>
		<p>From Cape Town I flew to Scotland and met up with a friend. We then toured Scotland and England.</p>

		<h3>Mozambique, Part II, 2012</h3>
			<ol>
				<ul><img width="500px" src="Images/Mozambique2.jpg">

			</ol>
		<p>This was my last trip to Africa as of the present day. We partnered with a Brazilian pastor and his team to minister to the natives in the beginning stages of their church plant.</p>
